# Happy Anniversary,

## poem about poem
started to write something  
but it became a poem,  
wanted to write one but  
it became three  

## your love:

I love you, but every time  
I forget that, I get pulled back right in  
watching the way you see,  
talk and kiss me  
days you cherish my enthusiasm  
and my fascination with food  
sorry for being so oblivious  
and sorry for remembering my love  
from you, i do admire you more  
in all these 365 days  
but it always felt lacking  
seeing the way you irretrievably fall  


## the walk :

our emotions have been quite the sine wave  
and I am responsible for   
most of the ripples  
every time we commit something bigger  
doubts and questions  
has always showed  
care and respect  
wonder how i got from   
getting to know you to  
you being my priority  


## romantic not-a-date :

when we first met  
had no clue on what i was doing  
knew you were questioning all the time  
what does this guy want  
where all i wanted was   
us to talk and talk  
still don't know how   
it let to the day when i came  
350 km just to see you  
and how it led to a   
romantic not-a-date
